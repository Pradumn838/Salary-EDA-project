# Salary Variation Analysis Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)




## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes how salary levels differ across demographic factors such as age, gender, education, and experience. The goal is to derive meaningful insights through rigorous exploratory data analysis and clear visual storytelling.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand the distribution of salaries across demographic groups
* Detect outliers and missing values
* Explore correlations between demographic variables and salary
* Visualize key trends using plots
* Generate insights that can guide data‑driven decisions

## 📂 Project Files

* **Exploratory Data Analysis of Salary Variation based on Demographics.ipynb** – Main Jupyter Notebook containing the full EDA
* **Dataset (optional)** – Include only if the dataset is allowed to be shared
* **README.md** – Documentation of the project

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 EDA Workflow

* Data loading and schema validation
* Initial observations and descriptive statistics
* Data cleaning: handling nulls, inconsistencies, and formatting issues
* Outlier detection and treatment
* Univariate and bivariate exploration
* Visual patterns using distribution plots, boxplots, heatmaps, and pairplots
* Identifying correlations and feature relationships

## 📊 Insights Summary

A deeper look at the data revealed several notable patterns:

* Certain demographic traits strongly influence salary bands.
* Age and experience show a positive correlation with salary but with diminishing returns in higher ranges.
* Some categories exhibit salary gaps, opening potential areas for fairness analysis.
* Distribution plots showed skewness in salary data, suggesting the need for transformations in modeling.
* Correlation heatmaps highlighted key relationships worth exploring in predictive models.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

* Salary distribution is not uniform and is influenced by multiple demographic variables.
* Visualizations revealed patterns not easily visible through raw statistics.
* The dataset contains insights that can guide compensation analysis and workforce planning.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Salary varies significantly across different demographic categories
* Certain demographic attributes show a strong association with salary
* Outliers and skewness in salary distribution required handling
* Visualizations helped identify key patterns and trends
